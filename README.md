# Stock-Market-Prediction-Project
This project forecasts stock market prices using machine learning. It uses yfinance to acquire real-time and historical data, pandas for data cleaning and feature engineering, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib to plot financial data, moving averages, and the final prediction results.

This repository contains a Python-based stock prediction model. The workflow includes:

1.Fetching historical stock data using yfinance.

2.Analyzing and preprocessing the data with pandas and numpy.

3.Visualizing stock trends and model performance with matplotlib.

4.Implementing an LSTM model with Keras/TensorFlow to forecast future prices.

5.Serving the trained model in an interactive web app built with Streamlit.
